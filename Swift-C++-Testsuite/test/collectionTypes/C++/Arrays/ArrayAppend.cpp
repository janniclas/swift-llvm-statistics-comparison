#include <vector>
int main()
{   
    std::vector<int> a;
    a.push_back(42);
}

// ChatGPT says:

// In C++, the main() function is usually defined as the entry point of a program, so the main() method of the MyMain struct is defined as a static member function and called from main().
// The Swift code uses an array literal to create an empty array of integers. In C++, we can use a std::vector to achieve a similar effect. The std::vector class is a template that requires a type parameter to specify the type of elements it will hold. In this case, we use std::vector<int> to create a vector of integers.
// To append an element to a std::vector, we can use the push_back() member function. This function adds the given element to the end of the vector.
