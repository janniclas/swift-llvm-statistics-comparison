# Closures Differences

## General Differences


## Programs with no equivalent C++ representation
* No explicit autoclosure with annotations in C++
* In C++, if you capture a variable which is defined in a function via reference you will get giberish as a result.
* In C++ many of the closure concepts of Swift don't exist. Thus we decided to only create some general examples which are more comparable.
