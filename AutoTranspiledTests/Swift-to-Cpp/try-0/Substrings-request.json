{"model":"text-davinci-003","prompt":"# Convert this from Swift to C++\n# Swift version\n// When you get a substring from a string—for example, using\n// a subscript or a method like prefix(_:)—the result is an\n// instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in\n// Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which\n// means you can work with substrings the same way you work\n// with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings\n// for only a short amount of time while performing actions\n// on a string. When you’re ready to store the result for a\n// longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String.\n\n// Don’t store substrings longer than you need them to perform a specific\n// operation. A substring holds a reference to the entire storage of the\n// string it comes from, not just to the portion it presents, even when\n// there is no other reference to the original string. Storing substrings\n// may, therefore, prolong the lifetime of string data that is no longer\n// otherwise accessible, which can appear to be memory leakage.\n@main\nstruct MyMain {\n\n    static func main() {\n        var greeting = \"Hello, world!\"\n        var index = greeting.firstIndex(of: \",\") ?? greeting.endIndex\n        var beginning = greeting[..<index]\n        // beginning is \"Hello\"\n\n        // Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.\n        var newString = String(beginning)\n    }\n}\n# End\n # C++ version","max_tokens":2048,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"stop":["###"]}
